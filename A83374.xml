            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

                        </opener>
                        <p>IT may seeme strange that I come so suddenly to end this Session, therefore before I give my assent to the Bills, I will tell you the Cause, though I must avow that I owe an account of my Actions to none but God alone. It is knowne to every one, that a while agoe the House of Commons gave mee a Remonstrance how acceptable every man may judge, and for the merit of it, I will not call that in question, for I am sure no wise man can justifie it.</p>
                        <p>Now since I am certainely informed that a second Remonstrance is preparing for me to take away my profit of Tonnage &amp; Poundage (one of the chiefe mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of the Crowne) by alleadging that I have given away my right thereof, by my Answer to your Petition:</p>
                        <p>This is prejudiciall unto me, that I am forced to end this Sessions some few howers before I meant it, being willing not to receive any more Remonstrances, to which I must give a harsh answere.</p>
                        <p>And since I see that even the House of Commons beginnes already to make false constructions of what I graunted in your Petition lest it be worse interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the Countrey, I will now make a Declaration concerning the true intent thereof.</p>
                        <p>The profession of both Houses in the time of hamm ring this Petition, was no waies to trench upon my Prerogative saying, They had neither intention nor power to hurt it.</p>
                        <p>Therefore it must needs be conceived, that I have granted no new, but onely confirmed the ancient Liberties of my Subjects‚ñ™ yet to shew the clearenesse of my intentions, that I neither repent nor meane to recede from any thing I have promised you, I doe here declare, that those things which have beene done, whereby men had some cause to suspect the Liberty of the subiects to be trencht upon (which indeede was the first and true ground of the Petition) shall not here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after be drawne into example for your prejudice: And in time to come (in the words of a King) you shall not have the like cause to complaine.</p>
                        <p>But as for Tonnage and Poundage, it is a thing I cannot want, and was never intended by you to aske, never meant (I am sure) by me to grant.</p>
                        <p>To conclude, I command you all that are heere, to take notice what I have spoken at this time, to be the true intent and meaning of what I granted you in your Petition‚ñ™ But especially you my Lords, the Iudges for to you onely under me belongs the interpretation of Lawes; for none of the House of Parliament, joyntly or seperate, (what new doctrine soever may bee raised) have any power, either to make or declare a Law without my consent.</p>
